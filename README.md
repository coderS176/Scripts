I bet you don't know this,

There is our project CodeBuddy(CLC3) üöÄ that brings together three popular coding platforms - #Leetcode, #Codechef, and #Codeforces - into a single hub for coding enthusiasts. On this platform, users can conveniently view their submissions and contest summaries from all three platforms in one place, as well as discover other users' profiles.

The team behind this endeavor consists of:

Shivam Gupta: üõ†Ô∏è Handling web scraping and APIs integration with expertise, utilizing #Python, #PlatformAPIs, #VS4, and #Docker. Prince Sharma: üíª Responsible for backend development and web application functionalities, employing a tech stack that includes #MySQL, #Django, #AWS (Lambda), and #Zappa for the backend, and #Next.js and #Tailwind CSS for the web application. Arnav Gupta: üì± Leading the Android application development efforts, utilizing #Flutter for seamless app development.

Moreover, the project introduces a unique feature called Room discussions. This feature fosters collaboration within the coding community, allowing users to engage in meaningful discussions, seek assistance, and share insights with fellow enthusiasts. üí¨ü§ù
